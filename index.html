    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>Our main mission with this website is to empower those with 
        a lacking education on the environment, what CO2 emmisions are 
        and how they ARE effecting their life, how they WILL, and how to help.
        For who knows how long people have had no idea what CO2 emmisions actually 
        mean, all they know is that it's bad but don't give it much thought. As a
        result many people disregard it and never do anything to help it because 
        they assume that their help will mean nothing.

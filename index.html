        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Our main mission with this website is to empower those with 
            a lacking education on the environment, what CO2 emmisions are 
            and how they ARE effecting their life, how they WILL, and how to help.
            For who knows how long people have had no idea what CO2 emmisions actually 
            mean, all they know is that it's bad but don't give it much thought. As a
            result many people disregard it and never do anything to help it because 
            they assume that their help will mean nothing.

        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
            Our main mission with this website is to empower those with a lacking education on the environment, what CO2 emissions are and how they ARE affecting their life, how they WILL, and how to help. For who knows how long people have had no idea what CO2 emissions actually mean, all they know is that it's bad but don't give it much thought. As a result many people disregard it and never do anything to help it because they assume that their help will mean nothing.

        <h1>Why This?</h1>
        <p>
            So, you're most likely wondering how exactly an excess amount of CO2 really affects us? Well, we're here to tell you how. Not only does an excess amount put human life at risk it also puts other organisms at risk such as animals. Although most animals right now aren't severely affected they will be eventually. Then most seafoods you like such as crab, shrimp and fish will no longer be available to you because of the high acidity in the ocean. This happens because as the ocean absorbs more CO2 acidity rises and habitats like coral reefs get bleached causing fishes and other organisms to migrate to other locations where they are invasive species setting off a chain reaction of great multitudes. On top of that the excess amount of CO2 will cause other particulates to make their way into human lungs causing asthma and other diseases similar.
